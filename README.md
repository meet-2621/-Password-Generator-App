🔐 Password Generator Web App
I created a sleek and responsive Password Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to generate secure passwords with customizable options like length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It also features password strength indication and a copy-to-clipboard functionality. The UI is modern, intuitive, and fully responsive with real-time interactivity. This project helped me strengthen my JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation skills.
